Here are the commands for setting up the queues... this was done using a user with DBO
privileges, obviously you would never use this sort of arrangement for a real app...
you'd apply the principle of least privilege, use a restricted account for runtime access and
not create or own database objects with that account, etc.


begin
dbms_aqadm.create_queue_table(
     queue_table=> 'source_qtab',
     queue_payload_type=>'sys.aq$_jms_text_message');
end;

begin
dbms_aqadm.create_queue(
     queue_name=>'source',
     queue_table=>'source_qtab'
);
end;

begin
dbms_aqadm.start_queue(queue_name=>'source');
end;


The source table DDL looks like:

create table sample(
added timestamp default current_timestamp not null,
data varchar2(4000)
);
